Project intented to experiment with

 - Functional programming
 - React
 - Redux
 - ClojureScript
 - Cellular Automata
 - SVG graphics
 
 
### Current state

 - Project uses React, Refux, SVG and implements a simple hardcoded rule for the cellular automata
 
 
### TODO

 - Make computation of new state more functional, perhaps with ClojureScript
 - Implement more rules
 - Add more interactivity
